# A-D-School-Supplies-
Website created for a class my sophomore year of college with 25 items and a working cart. The wesbite also had a punch in time for the Manager and the Employees along with a page for the Managers to update the inventory for the website itself. It also had a login page just to get into the website since the website was for a school project it was being hosted by the school servers.
